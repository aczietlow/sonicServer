# Sonic Server

Gotta Go Fast

## Objective

Learn more about networking, io, concurrency and parallelism models

## How

Build a simple server, that creates a socket and respond as fast as possible. To level the playing field as much as possible I will throw the server in the either the lowest tier Linode or a raspberry pi. 

### Extra

* Have the pis visualize the server load.
* Find a load testing tool
    * When in doubt, use locust.io
